# Python-for-Data-Science

When I attended an Information Session of Goldman Sachs at BYU-Idaho, I was inspired by one of the professionals who spoke about understanding the concept, not just get an A. He also said that you got to show your passion. Show that passion by joining a club, starting that project, reading that book, etc.

In another occasion, a data scientist from Databricks visited the Data Science Society at BYU-I. He spoke about the same thing. Strive to understand what you are doing, develop that passion, and do something with it. That will set you apart from the competition.

I started this repository to cultivate my growing passion for data analytics & data science. This project will contain everything I am learning about Python for Data Science. This repository will serve as a resource for me in the future, and hopefully to other aspiring analysts too.
